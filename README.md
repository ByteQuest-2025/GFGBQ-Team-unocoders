# EarlySignal — AI-Powered Silent Disease Risk Detection

### Overview
EarlySignal is a full-stack healthcare risk assessment system designed to detect silent or early-stage diseases such as diabetes and heart disease using machine learning.  
The project focuses on predictive prevention by generating risk probability scores instead of binary outcomes, helping identify health risks before clinical diagnosis.

### Disclaimer
⚠️ This project is built for educational and hackathon purposes only. It does not provide medical diagnoses or clinical recommendations.

### Problem Statement
A large percentage of life-threatening diseases remain undiagnosed for years because:
* Symptoms are mild or ignored  
* Health data is fragmented  
* Healthcare systems rely on reactive diagnosis  

EarlySignal addresses this gap by enabling early risk detection, explainable insights, and preventive awareness.

### Key Features
* 🔬 **Machine Learning–Based Risk Prediction** — Predicts disease risk as a probability score  
* 📊 **Explainable AI Outputs** — Shows contributing factors behind elevated risk  
* 🧪 **Multi-Dataset Training** — Trained using Kaggle diabetes and heart disease datasets  
* 🧩 **Modular Architecture** — Clean separation of frontend, backend, and ML logic  
* ⚡ **Real-Time Inference** — Fast predictions via Flask APIs  

### Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: React (Antigravity-generated UI)  
* **Backend**: Python, Flask  
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression), Pandas, NumPy  
* **Data**: Kaggle (Diabetes & Heart Disease datasets)  
* **Package Managers**: npm, pip
